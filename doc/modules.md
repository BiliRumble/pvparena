### Why are there different statuses?

PVP Arena exists since 2011 and Minecraft servers evolution make modules follow-up complicated. The objective of next
updates will be to make a great check-up of all of them and fix all eventual issues.

Anyway, don't hesitate to test legacy modules by yourself, a big part of them work normally or have trivial issues. Obviously
if you encounter one, you can report it üòâ
